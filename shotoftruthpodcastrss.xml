			<itunes:subtitle>DACA Supreme Court Hearing</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Shot of Truth Podcast traveled to Washington DC for the Supreme Court hearing on DACA. We interviewed people from Kansas, San Diego, Laredo, New York, San Francisco and more. Our community is so fucking powerful--it’s wild. Picture this: It was 25 degrees outside, the street in front of the Supreme Court was closed down and of course, there were tons of media. The crowds were flooded with people repping the campaign slogan, “Home is Here.” If you use social media YOU KNOW this campaign slogan. This episode is focused on highlighting the voices that are in the crowd!! The voices that traveled over mountains and rivers to be there for their communities. I also talk shit about, “Home is Here,” while acknowledging the work and thought  process that went behind it--we are critical of the things we love most! Always be critical of our movement, of those leading it, of ourselves. We are powerful and this episode celebrates that. We also briefly touch on the report USCIS released, “DACA requestors with an IDENT response.” Funny...how this came out right after the hearing. Enjoy, Home is Here?</itunes:summary>

He shares with us the work he’s done in the past around migrant workers and houseless folks. And what it’s like not knowing what the future of DACA holds for many of us. But really this episode is about sexxx. We talk about the best sex, sex positivity and what we do for sex. Sometimes that means driving for several hours or flying across the country only to find out he’s married. I know--this episode is full of all the tea on this beautiful human being.

			<itunes:subtitle>Conversation with Alejandra and Carolina</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>This episode we confront our anti-Blackness as non-Black undocumented latinx womxn. We share how we’ve been processing our role in supporting and uplifting Black lives. Starting with ourselves and extending to our families. We talk about the importance of holding ourselves, families and communities accountable to their anti-Blackness in order to continue fighting for Black communities. Black immigrants are targeted, detained and deported more so than other groups of people. Yet we never talk about this. As the DACA decision arises we want to hold non-Black DACA recipients accountable to not take space from Black Lives Matter but rather partner, collaborate, grow, give and hand over the fucking mic. Enjoy Part One: Call In to Non-Black Undocumented People.</itunes:summary>

			<itunes:subtitle>Highligting clips from this year.</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>We had some other amazing episodes including Journey to Self, Undocuboss, Gio Takes the States and My American Dream. 

Coming up next week will be our Holiday Special with Undocuprofessionals. And we will be wrapping up the New Year with someone really special to me and many of the people I’ve recorded with.

Intentions for 2021: Before I share our goals and intentions for this new year. I want to also share what I’ve been grieving. I’ve been grieving not seeing my family and friends. I feel so stagnant without human interaction. I am also grieving a lot of death. As many of us are. 

When we started this podcast I was very angry. I still am but I had no way of releasing my anger. Honestly, I’m calling this a relaunch/reintroduction because I am an evolving person. If you listen to some of our earlier episodes I was sad and you could hear the hurt in my voice, you could probably tell I was also under the influence for some. I have done a lot of thinking, healing and creating. And I’m truly pouring my heart into this work. 

Our intentions and goals for the year include:

-Consistency 
-Speaking Engagements (website re-launch)
-Finding Ways to make this work sustainable for us. 
	-We are looking for sponsors
	-Patron Growth
	- Partnerships
	-Productions 
All of this is possible because of you! If you cannot support us financially you can always share our page and episodes, word of mouth is powerful. 

Community Guidelines: 
Have Compassion for People.
Please Give us Constructive Feedback
Build w/ Us.

Again thank you thank you for everything. We love ya’ll and happy holidays. 

-can you pass me a shot plzzz-

The need to make mutual aid accessible to people who speak a different language, those who do not have access to a car or computer to apply. The need for ground communal organizing is how many communities in Texas have survived. I also ask what is happening near the border and at detention centers.

			<itunes:summary>I really have to hype this person up because they’re doing incredible work. Kevin Muñoz came to the United States From Guatemala and has lived across the country in California, Colorado, and New Jersey. He is giving people the tools they need to start navigating the financial world themselves regardless of immigration status. My favorite thing about this is that he does it both in English and Spanish and makes all his work accessible on youtube, podcast platforms, and on his website. In this episode we talk all about investing in yourself, creating a financial vision and the impact Latinos have on the US economy. From retirement to emergency funds to how to buy your first home--Latin American Educational Opportunity Podcast (LEO podcast) has it all. “The LEO Podcast was created with the purpose to breakdown barriers within the Latinx community and shed light on topics that aren’t typically brought up in our households like finances, mental health, politics, and many more.” We also talk about the importance of being a conscious entrepreneur and investor--we are human before anything else.

From retirement to emergency funds to how to buy your first home--Latin American Educational Opportunity Podcast (LEO podcast) has it all. “The LEO Podcast was created with the purpose to breakdown barriers within the Latinx community and shed light on topics that aren’t typically brought up in our households like finances, mental health, politics, and many more.” We also talk about the importance of being a conscious entrepreneur and investor--we are human before anything else. Join us on this episode, Financial Liberation for All.

Maydelli shares with her following the vulnerability and struggle she has faced and tackled in hopes of inspiring others to do the same. I listened to this episode and again felt emotion evoked in my body, mind, and spirit. I get called into doing work I’m avoiding and I feel that. I hope this episode finds you and you find in it what you need. Enjoy!

			<itunes:summary>Yes, you read that right. THE MOTHER FUCKING AUDACITY featuring ME This episode is all about things I’ve been processing over the last several months including my relationship with alcohol, dating apps, and people I’ve had to let go to make space for all this. You get some of my key takeaways from the Launch Latinx Accelerator Program. I will be doing an IG LIVE with them this Friday! This episode is a little bit of everything and a mash-up of rants, messiness, and more. (It’s funny because I recorded this last weekend and I already feel differently about some of my talking points.) ANYWAY, go out there and be audacious--that’s the message. Enjoy.

			<itunes:subtitle>Interview with Dario Andrade Mendoza</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Chronic Loneliness impacts millions of people across the world. Here in the United States, 46% of the general population feels lonely often. In this episode, we talk about the impacts of chronic loneliness at large and also as immigrants. We share personal experiences on how loneliness has manifested in our lives and impacted those around us. Regardless of money, fame, power, beauty--we all are subject to feeling lonely because it is part of our biology! It is nothing to be ashamed of but rather something to be aware of and notice how you are meeting your social needs. This is a heavy topic but Dario Andrade Mendoza does an excellent job of keeping it light and lively. Dario is joining us for his second episode, so if you like this one please check out Arizona Living! Enjoy!

			<itunes:subtitle>Interview with Panchito Ramirez</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Panchito Ramirez is a first-generation immigrant, Speaker, and Founder of Dreamer Soccer Clinic. Panchito is on a mission to impact the lives of immigrant youth by sharing his story and creating spaces like the Dreamer Soccer Clinic. Panchito is the most affirming, giving, selfless leader--(my heart and glass felt so full after this recording.) As we talked about the importance of creating community spaces, we decided this episode was going to be about having difficult conversations. We talk about critical consciousness, how to approach a difficult conversation, and when it’s time to walk away. As we enter the holiday season we KNOW things get a little tense. We got you. Enjoy!

			<itunes:subtitle>Interview with Aisha Mansour</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Aisha Mansour is a revolutionary Palestinian feminist and organizer.  Aisha is a part of many organizations including Falastiniyat and the Palestinian Youth Movement. She shares with us so many beautiful stories of her family, including the first time she realized her life was going to be devoted to the struggle and liberation of her people. We cover the various campaigns she is working on, including Save Al-Walaja, and reframing the purpose of doing this work--it is far beyond advocacy. We talk about US complacency, parallels of settler colonialism, and what it means to be in a joint struggle. This episode was all the feels from beginning to end. Co-produced by Aline Prata.
