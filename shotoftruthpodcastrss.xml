			<itunes:subtitle>DACA Supreme Court Hearing</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>Shot of Truth Podcast traveled to Washington DC for the Supreme Court hearing on DACA. We interviewed people from Kansas, San Diego, Laredo, New York, San Francisco and more. Our community is so fucking powerful--it’s wild. Picture this: It was 25 degrees outside, the street in front of the Supreme Court was closed down and of course, there were tons of media. The crowds were flooded with people repping the campaign slogan, “Home is Here.” If you use social media YOU KNOW this campaign slogan. This episode is focused on highlighting the voices that are in the crowd!! The voices that traveled over mountains and rivers to be there for their communities. I also talk shit about, “Home is Here,” while acknowledging the work and thought  process that went behind it--we are critical of the things we love most! Always be critical of our movement, of those leading it, of ourselves. We are powerful and this episode celebrates that. We also briefly touch on the report USCIS released, “DACA requestors with an IDENT response.” Funny...how this came out right after the hearing. Enjoy, Home is Here?</itunes:summary>

He shares with us the work he’s done in the past around migrant workers and houseless folks. And what it’s like not knowing what the future of DACA holds for many of us. But really this episode is about sexxx. We talk about the best sex, sex positivity and what we do for sex. Sometimes that means driving for several hours or flying across the country only to find out he’s married. I know--this episode is full of all the tea on this beautiful human being.

Starting with ourselves and extending to our families. We talk about the importance of holding ourselves, families and communities accountable to their anti-Blackness in order to continue fighting for Black communities. Black immigrants are targeted, detained and deported more so than other groups of people. Yet we never talk about this. As the DACA decision arises we want to hold non-Black DACA recipients accountable to not take space from Black Lives Matter but rather partner, collaborate, grow, give and hand over the fucking mic.

From organizing in high school to working at the state and national capitol--he’s all about it.

			<itunes:subtitle>Highligting clips from this year.</itunes:subtitle>
			<itunes:summary>We had some other amazing episodes including Journey to Self, Undocuboss, Gio Takes the States and My American Dream. 

Coming up next week will be our Holiday Special with Undocuprofessionals. And we will be wrapping up the New Year with someone really special to me and many of the people I’ve recorded with.

Intentions for 2021: Before I share our goals and intentions for this new year. I want to also share what I’ve been grieving. I’ve been grieving not seeing my family and friends. I feel so stagnant without human interaction. I am also grieving a lot of death. As many of us are. 

When we started this podcast I was very angry. I still am but I had no way of releasing my anger. Honestly, I’m calling this a relaunch/reintroduction because I am an evolving person. If you listen to some of our earlier episodes I was sad and you could hear the hurt in my voice, you could probably tell I was also under the influence for some. I have done a lot of thinking, healing and creating. And I’m truly pouring my heart into this work. 

Our intentions and goals for the year include:

-Consistency 
-Speaking Engagements (website re-launch)
-Finding Ways to make this work sustainable for us. 
	-We are looking for sponsors
	-Patron Growth
	- Partnerships
	-Productions 
All of this is possible because of you! If you cannot support us financially you can always share our page and episodes, word of mouth is powerful. 

Community Guidelines: 
Have Compassion for People.
Please Give us Constructive Feedback
Build w/ Us.

Again thank you thank you for everything. We love ya’ll and happy holidays.
